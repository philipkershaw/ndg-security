Integration Tests for OpenID Relying Party based Single Sign On
===============================================================
A simple example application securedapp.py is secured with an Authentication
handler which redirects HTTP 401 Responses to an OpenID Relying Party
middleware application running in securityservicesapp.py.  The aim is to
illustrate a simplified view of the eventual NDG deployment where applications
will be secured running under a separate stack to security services running
under SSL.  This test tests the security stack with only an OpenID Relying 
Party in place.  No authorisation components are included.

An OpenID account with an external OpenID Provider is required in order to run
this test.  The NDG OpenID Provider is deliberately omitted from this test for
simplicity.  See openid/ integration test in the parent directory for a test
deployment with OpenID Provider and Relying Party combined.

To run:

$ ./securityservicesapp.py

and in a separate window:

$ ./securedapp.py

Start a browser and enter the address:

http://localhost:6080

You will be redirected to a page to enter your OpenID.  Enter your preferred
OpenID and proceed to sign in.  On return to the test site it will display a 
message with an option to logout.  Click on the link to logout.
