MyProxyClient Unit Tests
========================
To set-up this test, A MyProxy server process must be running to test against.
MyProxy is installed as part of the NDG Security installation.  See the 
installation guide for details:

http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/ndg/browser/TI12-security/trunk/documentation/InstallationGuide/pdf/NDGSecurityInstallationGuide.pdf?format=raw

1) Start myproxy-server on it's host machine e.g. as root run,

$ myproxy-server

2) Edit myProxyProperties.xml and set the hostname element to the fully
qualified domain name of the MyProxy host OR alternatively set the environment
variable MYPROXY_SERVER to the host name.

3) Run the tests with the command:

$ python ./MyProxyClientTest.py

4) To run individual tests give the test method name:

$ python ./MyProxyClientTest.py MyProxyClientTestCase.test1Store

 * Note that some tests are dependent on the output of previous tests.  
 * test1Store adds a new credential to the repository.  Running all the tests
   together as in 3) will ensure the credential is removed afterwards.  To
   check the existence of the credential after the test run test3Info:
   
   $ python ./MyProxyClientTest.py MyProxyClientTestCase.test3Info
   
   or use MyProxy client commands on the MyProxy host: myproxy-info,
   myproxy-destroy.  If these fail, the content of /var/myproxy on the 
   target host can be checked to see if testuser credentials still exist.
 * See myProxyClientTest.cfg configuration file to change test parameters.
 * See the installation guide for MyProxy trouble shooting information.
