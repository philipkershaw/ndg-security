""".. WSGI Policy Enforcement Point Package

Authorisation is managed within a WSGI filter architecture.  An authorisation \
WSGI filter is configured in a chain of filters to secure a given application. \ 
filter intercepts requests and either makes an access control or passes on an \
access control request to a third-party authorisation service to make the \
decision on its behalf.

When a decision is made, the filter enforces it by accepting the request, \
making an access denied response or flagging an error:

* Access Permitted: it passes on the HTTP request on to the next WSGI filter \
in the chain .  If there are now more filters, control will pass to the \
underlying application.
* Access Denied: it returns a HTTP 403 Forbidden response.  Other filters may \
intercept this response as required - e.g. to display a prettified error \
message to a browser client applying stylesheets and graphics etc.
* Error: if an error occurs a 500 response is returned.  Again, another filter \
could intercept this and perform some other appropriate action.

Filters have been developed for the Earth System Grid Federation.  These use a \
client-server architecture for authorisation.  A authorisation service - \
typically one per organisation - handles access control decisions.

In this case, the WSGI authorisation filter has a special component, a PEP \
(Policy Enforcement Point).  The PEP makes the requests to the authorisation \
service.  Inside the authorisation service a *PDP* (Policy *Decision* Point) \
makes access control decisions based on the incoming request from the PEP and \
access control policy that it holds.

The PEP *enforces* decisions it receives back from the authorisation service \
in the same way as described in the above bullets.

Using a client-server architecture is helpful as it enables the centralisation \
of authorisation policy across a range of services in a given organisation.  \
The drawback is that there is added complexity in managing the client-server \
interactions especially if these themselves need to be secured.

Equally it is possible to implement an authorisation filter which makes its \
own authorisation decisions without the need for a separate authorisation \
service.

    ``AuthorisationFilter`` is a WSGI filter that can be configured to wrap a \
    given WSGI application and apply an authorisation policy.  The filter \
    itself uses a client/server pattern: a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in \
    the filter calls out to a separate PDP (Policy Decision Point) running in \
    an authorisation web service.  This service uses a uses a SAML/SOAP \
    binding for communication.  The PEP makes queries using the SAML \
    Authorisation Decision Query.  This allows querying based on requested \
    URI and HTTP method used (e.g. POST, PUT, GET).  This service is \
    compatible with the ESGF Security Architecture.  This means that this \
    filter can be configured to callout to an ESGF implementation of the \
    Authorisation Service.

    This is a variant on the \
    ``ndg.security.server.wsgi.authz.AuthorisationFilter``.  The XACML name \
    relates to the format of messages used to make queries to the \
    *Authorisation Service*.  Like the ``AuthorisationFilter``, it uses a \
    SAML/SOAP binding for communication with the latter.  The SAML \
    Authorisation Decision Query is modified to use features from XACML, the \
    eXtensible Mark-up Language.  XACML is both a data model and an XML \
    serialisation for expressing access control policies and also for \
    exchanging messages for communicating authorisation queries and \
    responses.  The latter is what is being exploited here.  This allows a \
    richer functionality for expressing access queries, for example the \
    ability to make decisions based on XQuery'd content and also to allow \
    for a richer code list for access control decisions.
