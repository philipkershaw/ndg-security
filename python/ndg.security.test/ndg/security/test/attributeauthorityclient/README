Unit tests for Attribute Authority Web Service Client
=====================================================
The test client connects to two different test Attribute Authorities
corresponding to the fictitious Service Providers Site "A" and Site "B".  Each
has its own respective configuration.  As they are also used in other tests,
this configuration is held in a separate config/ directory parallel to this
one. 

These services must be started before running the unit tests.  Start a terminal
in this directory and run:

$ python ../config/attributeauthority/sitea/siteAServerApp.py

...and in a separate terminal:

$ python ../config/attributeauthority/siteb/siteBServerApp.py

Configuration for these services is held in the files 

../config/attributeauthority/sitea/site-a.ini and
../config/attributeauthority/siteb/site-b.ini 

respectively.

Note however that the siteBServerApp.py is only needed for tests for getting 
mapped attribute certificates: test07GetMappedAttCert and 
test08GetMappedAttCertStressTest

Settings for the client to these services are configured with the file
attAuthorityClientTest.cfg.  The default values should work as set.

Problems may occur due to proxy settings (Access Denied errors); no proxy 
should be specified for the ports used by the services - i.e. use:

$ unset http_proxy

or set specific exceptions according to the address+port of the services used:

$ export no_proxy=localhost:5100,localhost:5000

Run the unit tests script test_attributeauthorityclient.py from another
terminal:

$ python ./test_attributeauthorityclient.py

Tests can be run individually e.g.

$ python ./test_attributeauthorityclient.py AttributeAuthorityClientTestCase.test01GetHostInfo
