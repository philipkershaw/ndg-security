Integration Tests to test NDG Security Authentication and Authorisation
=======================================================================
Test an example HTTP WSGI application with the full security system including 
OpenID Relying Party, Provider, SAML Attribute and Authorisation services and
SSL client based authentication.

To run,

$ python securedapp.py

...and in another terminal:

$ python securityservicesapp.py

Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:7080.  This displays a page with a
list of links.  Each link tests out a different aspect of the authorisation
system.  The OpenID login will be triggered if a link requires authentication,
select go with the default URL set of, "http://localhost:7443/openid".  When
prompted for a username and password, enter pjk/testpassword 
respectively.

The links are secured with the policy file, policy.xml.  User attributes are
determined by the Attribute Authority configuration set in the user.db example
database

Tests for XACML profile and AttributeSelector
=============================================
To test using the XACML profile, run securityservicesapp and securedapp using
alternative configuration files as follows:

$ python securedapp.py -c <absolute path of full_system directory>/securedapp_xacml_profile.ini

$ python securityservicesapp.py -f <absolute path of full_system directory>/securityservices_xacml_profile.ini

If a request is posted to securedapp, the post data is included as resource
content in the XACML request. The post data should be valid XML - if it is not,
an error will result. There are two test policies and examples of post data:
o policy-attr-sel.xml /  post.xml
  This is a simple example using an AttributeSelector to match a value.
o policy-attr-sel-cond-xpath.xml / post-for-cond-xpath.xml
  This is a more complex example using a condition in the XPath expression.
  xml.etree cannot handle the XPath expression and lxml is required. If
  xml.etree is used, the decision should be indeterminate as a result of an
  error parsing the XPath expression.
  To use this policy, modify securityservices_xacml_profile.ini to set
  policy-attr-sel-cond-xpath.xml as the policy.

A post request can be made using curl:
curl --data @post.xml http://localhost:7080/test_401
