Unit tests for NDG Security Session Manager Module
==================================================
These tests need some careful attention to their configuration in order to 
correctly set up.  Test Attribute Authorities services must be 
configured and started.
 
1) Two test Attribute Authority services are required.  These can be run from 
the Attribute Authority Client unit test directory.  It's path relative to this 
directory is ../attributeauthorityclient/.  Run each service in a separate 
window so that the output can be monitored:

$ ../attributeauthorityclient/siteA/siteAServerApp.py
$ ../attributeauthorityclient/siteB/siteBServerApp.py

2) Run the tests with the command:

$ python ./test_sessionmanager.py

3) To run individual tests give the test method name:

$ python ./test_sessionmanager.py SessionManagerTestCase.test1Connect

Finally,
 * See sessionMgrTest.cfg sets the unittest configuration
 * sessionMgr.cfg sets the Session Manager configuration

Troubleshooting:
 * http_proxy environment variable settings can cause connection problems to
the Attribute Authorities.  unset http_proxy or set no_proxy:

$ export no_proxy=http://localhost:5000/AttributeAuthority,http://localhost:5100/AttributeAuthority
