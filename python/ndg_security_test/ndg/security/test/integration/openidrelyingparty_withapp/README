Authorisation Integration Tests with the OpenID Relying Party running in the
============================================================================
Application Stack
=================
In this test, the OpenID Relying Party Middleware is configured to run in the
same WSGI stack as the application being protected.  This ensures that the
two are in the same cookie domain but if the application is running over HTTP
then the RP will likewise.  The alternative is to run the OpenID RP in the 
security services middleware stack together with the OpenID Provider and 
Attribute Authority.  This enables the RP to run over HTTPS but it also 
involves a redirect from the app to the RP on signin which may itself be a 
security weakness.

To run,

$ python securedapp.py

...and in another terminal:

$ python securityservicesapp.py

Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:7080.  This displays a page with a
list of links.  Each link tests out a different aspect of the authorisation
system.  The OpenID login will be triggered if a link requires authentication,
select go with the default URL set of, "http://localhost:7443/openid".  When
prompted for a username and password, enter pjk/testpassword 
respectively.

The links are secured with the policy file, policy.xml.  User attributes are
determined by the Attribute Authority configuration set in 
ndg.security.test.config.attributeauthority.sitea.siteAUserRoles
