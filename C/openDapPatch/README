The ncopen test program in this directory demonstrates NetCDF OPeNDAP access 
with ESG based security.  Requests are authenticated with the server with SSL 
client authentication.  The patch/ directory contains old code for a patch to
the 4.1.1 NetCDF libraries.  This patch is now integrated into the trunk and 
as of writing is part of the 4.1.2 beta2 release.  This test program has been
tried with NetCDF snapshots starting from 
netcdf-4.1.2-beta1-snapshot20100829202 and also with the beta2 release.
To test the integrated code follow these steps:  

1) Get NetCDF

$ wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4.1.2-beta2.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf ./netcdf-4.1.2-beta2.tar.gz

Configure with curl to enable OPeNDAP functionality:

$ cd ./netcdf-4.1.2-beta2
$ ./configure --with-curl-config=/usr/bin/curl-config --enable-shared

Then build the NetCDF libraries:

$ make

2) Make the example program:

$ cd ..
$ make

3) Ensure that the NetCDF library can be picked up:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./netcdf-4.1.2-beta2/liblib/.libs

4) Get credentials e.g.

$ myproxy-logon -b -s myproxy.myhomeinstitution.somewhere -o creds.pem

The example will work with proxy or standard X.509 certificates.

5) Set .dodsrc file to pick up the credentials:

$ vi ~/.dodsrc
.
.
.
CURL.VERBOSE=1
CURL.COOKIEJAR=.dods_cookies
CURL.SSL.VALIDATE=1
CURL.SSL.CERTIFICATE=/.../creds.pem
CURL.SSL.KEY=/.../creds.pem
CURL.SSL.CAPATH=<HOME DIRECTORY>/.globus/certificates

6) Run the example program:

$ ./ncopen <OPeNDAP URI>

This should print out info about variables from the file.
