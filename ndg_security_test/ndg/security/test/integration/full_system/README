Integration Tests to test NDG Security Authentication and Authorisation
=======================================================================
Test an example HTTP WSGI application with the full security system including 
OpenID Relying Party, Provider, SAML Attribute and Authorisation services and
SSL client based authentication.

To run,

$ python securedapp.py

...and in another terminal:

$ python securityservicesapp.py

Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:7080.  This displays a page with a
list of links.  Each link tests out a different aspect of the authorisation
system.  The OpenID login will be triggered if a link requires authentication,
select go with the default URL set of, "http://localhost:7443/openid".  When
prompted for a username and password, enter pjk/testpassword 
respectively.

The links are secured with the policy file, policy.xml.  User attributes are
determined by the Attribute Authority configuration set in the user.db example
database
