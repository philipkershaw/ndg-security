OpenID Provider Integration Test
================================
This directory contains an integration test for the OpenID Provider.  A sample
Provider is included along with an OpenID Relying Party app to test it with. To
test, in one terminal run:

$ ./openidproviderapp.py

In a second terminal, run:

$ ./openidrelyingpartyapp.py

Launch a browser and enter the address http://localhost:7080.  Follow the 
instructions to test it out.  When redirected to the OpenID Provider login page
enter pjk/testpassword as the username/password combination.
