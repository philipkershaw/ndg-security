Site A Test Attribute Authority Service
=======================================
This directory contains the configuration information for an Attribute 
Authority test service used by the unit tests:

 - site-aa.ini: main configuration file for the service which also contains
   Paste config to enable running the service with paster:
   
   $ paster serve site-a.ini
      
 - sitea_attributeauthority.py: script to invoke the service:
 
   $ python ./sitea_attributeauthority.py
   
   This script can be used to test the service but the unit tests start up and
   close down attribute authority instances atuomatically.  See: 
   ndg.security.test.unit.BaseTestCase
   
 - sitea_attributeinterface.py: attribute interface plugin to the Attribute 
   Authority determines what attributes a given user is entitled to.  In a 
   production deployment this might link to a user database or other repository.
