Pam_OCI8 Version 0.1

To try this, you need PAM to already be installed and working and have a
Oracle 8.x/9.x (8.x not tested) server up and running as well. I typically copy the pam_oci8.so to
/lib/security and make the proper changes to /etc/pam.d/ and /etc/pam.conf

An example of a config file:
auth       optional     pam_oci8.so connectString=dbuser/password@host table=TUSER usercolumn=LOGINNAME passwdcolumn=PASSWORD
account    required     pam_oci8.so connectString=dbuser/password@host table=TUSER usercolumn=LOGINNAME passwdcolumn=PASSWORD

The options that it understands are: 

connectString: string required to connect to oracle DB: user/passwd@host, example: dbuser/password@host

table -- table that you want to use for the user/password checking

usercolumn -- column that has the username field

passwdcolumn -- column that has the password field 

where("") -- Used to specify additional criteria for the query. On Sql errors, you can see 
	    the Sql-Query via syslogd
