Site B Test Attribute Authority Service
=======================================
This directory contains the configuration information for an Attribute 
Authority test service used by the unit tests:

 - site-aa.ini: main configuration file for the service which also contains
   Paste config to enable running the service with paster:
   
   $ paster serve site-b.ini
   
 - siteBAttributeAuthority.cfg: example standalone Attribute Authority config
   file without Paste configuration
   
 - siteBMapConfig.xml: configures trust relationships with other organisations
   (site b for the tests)
   
 - siteBServerApp.py: script to invoke the service:
 
   $ python ../siteBServerApp.py
   
   This script is used as a convenience method for running the unit tests.
   
 - siteBUserRoles.py: attribute interface plugin to the Attribute Authority
   determines what attributes a given user is entitled to.  In a production
   deployment this might link to a user database or other repository.
