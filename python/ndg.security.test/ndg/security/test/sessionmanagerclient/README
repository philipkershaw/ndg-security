Unit tests for Session Manager Web Service Client
=================================================
This is the most complicated unit test suite and requires a number of services
to be running:
 * Test Session Manager web service run from this directory
 * Two test Attribute Authorities run from the Attribute Authority unit test
 directory ../attributeauthority
 
It is worthwhile trying out the Attribute Authority 
(../attributeauthorityclient) and Session Manager (../sessionmanager) unit 
tests first.  These tests differ from the Session Manager unit tests in that 
they test a SOAP *client* to a Session Manager web service whereas the Session 
Manager tests just the server side code. 
 
The Attribute Authorities and Session Manager accept client requests
authenticated based on user credentials obtained in the unit test
test01Connect.  

1) Start the Session Manager test service in this directory but from a separate
terminal:

$ python ../config/sessionmanager/sessionManagerServerApp.py

2) Two test Attribute Authority services are required.  These can be run from 
the Attribute Authority Client unit test directory.  It's path relative to this 
directory is ../attributeauthorityclient/.  Run each service in a separate 
window so that the output can be monitored:

$ python ../config/attributeauthority/sitea/siteAServerApp.py

...and in a separate terminal:

$ python ../config/attributeauthority/siteb/siteBServerApp.py

Configuration for these services is held in the files 

../config/sessionmanager/session-manager.ini
../config/attributeauthority/sitea/site-a.ini
../config/attributeauthority/siteb/site-b.ini 

respectively.

5) Run the tests with the command:

$ python ./test_sessionmanagerclient.py

6) To run individual tests give the test method name:

$ python ./test_sessionmanagerclient.py SessionManagerClientTestCase.test01Connect

Finally, see sessionMgrClientTest.cfg configuration file to change test 
parameters.
