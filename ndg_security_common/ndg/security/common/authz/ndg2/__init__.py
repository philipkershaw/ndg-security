"""NDG2 Security authorisation package - contains code for NDG2 implementations
of the PDP and PEP.  Importantly, these contain the NDG Security interface
for ProFTP file based authorisation used by the current BADC website (as of
writing 19/02/10).  All the code in this package is expected to be retired
when the NDG MSI / ESG based security replaces it.  This uses a security 
policy based on an XML policy file.  See the msi module.
