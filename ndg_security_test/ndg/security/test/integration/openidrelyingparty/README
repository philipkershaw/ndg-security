Integration Tests for OpenID Relying Party and SSL based Authentication
=======================================================================
A simple example application securedapp.py is secured with an Authentication
handler which redirects HTTP 401 Responses to this application which consists
of an OpenID Relying Party application and SSL Client based Authentication 
filter running in securityservicesapp.py.  With this arrangement, clients may
authenticate with the application either using OpenID or over SSL by providing
a user certificate.  

This particular configuration is important for use when deploying data access
services which need to support both OpenID and SSL client based authentication
as with ESGF.

An OpenID account with an external OpenID Provider is required in order to run
this test.  See openidprovider/ integration test for details of how to run the
OpenID Provider application.

To run:

$ ./authenticationservicesapp.py

and in a separate window:

$ ./securedapp.py

[also openidproviderapp.py in openidprovider/ if needed]

Start a browser and enter the address:

http://localhost:6080

You will be redirected to a page to enter your OpenID.  Enter your preferred
OpenID and proceed to sign in.  On return to the test site it will display a 
message with an option to logout.  Click on the link to logout.
