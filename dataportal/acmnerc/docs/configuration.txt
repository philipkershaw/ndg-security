Configuring ACMFor configuring the Access Control Module, two sections have to be configured. 1. Configuration of the database for storing Access privileges2. Configuration of the 'acm.properties' file to point to the access privileges database in /web/WEB-INF directory. 1. Configuring the  Database.The database utilized by the Access Control module is a Postgres database. A database need to be created with a table named user table.  The table can be created in Postgres with the script below.    CREATE TABLE "usertable" (        "username" character varying(30) NOT NULL,        "facility" boolean,        "metadata" boolean,        "data" boolean,        Constraint "usertable_pkey" Primary Key ("username")     );Alternatively,  you could restore the database to posgres database by utilizing the template database provided. # createdb -T template0 <dbname>#psql <dbname> < acmtemplate.bakeg:	# createdb -T template0 acmdb	# createdb acmdb < acmtemplate.bak2. Configuring acm.properties fileThe description of the database needs to be specified in the acm.properties file. This file is read by the ACM module for accessing the database.SERVER : Specify the the sever address where the database is hostedPORT: Port number in which the database is listning on.FACILITYNAME: name of the facility DATABASENAME: name of the databaseUSERNAME: Database username PASSWORD: Password of userExample:   SERVER=//escdmg.dl.ac.uk   PORT=5432   FACILITYNAME=BADC   DATABASENAME=acmdb   USERNAME=dbusername   PASSWORD=dbpassword
