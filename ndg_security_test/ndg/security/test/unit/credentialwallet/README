Unit tests for NDG Credential Wallet Module
===========================================
Test Attribute Authorities services must be started for *AttCert* named tests.
 
1) Two test Attribute Authority services are required.  These services must be
started before running the unit tests.  Start a terminal in this directory and 
run:

$ python ../../config/attributeauthority/sitea/siteAServerApp.py

...and in a separate terminal:

$ python ../../config/attributeauthority/siteb/siteBServerApp.py

Configuration for these services is held in the files 

../../config/attributeauthority/sitea/site-a.ini and
../../config/attributeauthority/siteb/site-b.ini 

respectively.

5) Run the tests with the command:

$ python ./test_credentialwallet.py

6) To run individual tests give the test method name:

$ python ./test_credentialwallet.py CredentialWalletTestCase.test1ReadOnlyClassVariables

Finally,
 * See credWalletTest.cfg sets the unittest configuration
 * credWallet.cfg sets the Credential Wallet's configuration

Troubleshooting:
 * http_proxy environment variable settings can cause connection problems to
the Attribute Authorities.  unset http_proxy or set no_proxy:

$ export no_proxy=http://localhost:5000/AttributeAuthority,http://localhost:5100/AttributeAuthority
