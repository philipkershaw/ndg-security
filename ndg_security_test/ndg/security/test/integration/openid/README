Integration Tests for OpenID Relying Party and Provider Middleware
==================================================================
A simple example application securedapp.py is secured with an Authentication
handler which redirects HTTP 401 Responses to an OpenID middleware application 
running in securityservicesapp.py.  

An OpenID account with an external OpenID Provider is required in order to run
this test.  The NDG OpenID Provider is deliberately omitted from this test for
simplicity.  See openid/ integration test in the parent directory for a test
deployment with OpenID Provider and Relying Party combined.

To run:

$ ./securityservicesapp.py

and in a separate window:

$ ./securedapp.py

Start a browser and enter the address:

http://localhost:9080

You will be redirected to a page to enter your OpenID.   On return to the test site it will display a 
message with an option to logout.  Click on the link to logout.
