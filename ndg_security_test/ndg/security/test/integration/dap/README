Integration Tests securing of a pyDAP service
=============================================
pyDAP is an example data application service that can be secured with NDG
Security.  pyDAP implements the OPeNDAP protocol.  To install pyDAP:

$ sudo easy_install pydap

pyDAP requires the numerical python package numpy.  This may require 
installation as a separate step:

$ sudo easy_install numpy

Plugins enable the handling of different data types.  For NetCDF data,

$ sudo easy_install pydap.handlers.netcdf
$ sudo easy_install pydap.responses.netcdf

To run,

$ paster serve server.ini

...and in another terminal run the security services application from the 
authz integration test:

$ python ../authz/securityservicesapp.py

Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:8001.  This displays a page with a
list of data files as included in the ./data directory.  The default with this
installation is a sample comma separated variable format file.  Put example
NetCDF files in this directory in order to test NetCDF access capabilities.

The OpenID login will be triggered if a link such as the sample.csv, requires 
authentication.  Select go with the default URL set of, 
"http://localhost:7443/openid".  When prompted for a username and password, 
enter pjkersha/testpassword respectively.

The links are secured with the policy file, authz/policy.xml.  This has
target entries corresponding to URI patterns to secure.  Add new targets
for any given dataset or URI pattern needing to be secured.

User attributes are determined by the Attribute Authority configuration set in 
ndg.security.test.config.attributeauthority.sitea.siteAUserRoles
