# Description: NDG Security configuration to secure a given WSGI application.  
#              Security filters placed in front of the application in the WSGI 
#              pipeline act as client to security services running on a separate
#              application stack.  - See 
#              ndg.security.test.integration.full_system or the 
#              ndgsecurity_services template.
