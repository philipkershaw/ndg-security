Integration Tests for OpenID Relying Party (SSL based) and Provider 
===================================================================
A simple example application securedapp.py is secured with an Authentication
handler which redirects unauthenticated requests to an OpenID Relying Party
application running in securityservicesapp.py over HTTPS.  This configuration
has advantages for maintaining an encrypted channel between Relying Party and 
Provider during the sign in process.  It also enables the Relying Party app
to include other middleware requiring SSL such as an SSL Client authentication
filter.  This is important for the ESGF security architecture where apps are
secured with both OpenID and SSL client based authentication. 

To run:

$ ./securityservicesapp.py

and in a separate window:

$ ./securedapp.py

Start a browser and enter the address:

http://localhost:9080

Follow the instructions given on the web page in order to test the app out.
