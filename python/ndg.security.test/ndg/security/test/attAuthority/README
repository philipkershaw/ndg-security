Unit tests for Attribute Authority Web Service Client
=====================================================
The test client connects to two different test Attribute Authorities
corresponding to the fictitious Service Providers Site "A" and Site "B".  Each
has it's own respective properties file.  These services must be started before
running the unit tests.  Start a terminal in this directory and run:

$ python ./siteAServer.py

...and in a separate terminal:

$ python ./siteBServer.py

Note however that the siteBServer is only needed for tests for getting mapped 
certificates: test7GetMappedAttCert and test8GetMappedAttCertStressTest

Settings for the client to these services are configured with 
attAuthorityClientTest.cfg.  The default values should work as set.

Run the unit tests script AttAuthorityClientTest.py from another terminal:

$ python ./AttAuthorityClientTest.py

Tests can be run individually e.g.

$ python ./AttAuthorityClientTest.py AttAuthorityClientTestCase.test1GetX509Cert
