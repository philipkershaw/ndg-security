Integration Tests to test NDG Authorisation without a Session Manager
=====================================================================
In the authz integration test parallel to this directory, a Session Manager is
included in the security services paster application.  This service caches
security credentials for efficiency.  It is queried by the 
AuthorizationFilter's Policy Information Point in order to retrieve user
attribute certificates.  In this configuration, the PIP contacts the 
Attribute Authority directly to retrieving Attribute Certificates rather than
going via the Session Manager intermediary.  This simplifies the configuration
but with a possible performance penalty.

To run,

$ python securedapp.py

...and in another terminal:

$ python securityservicesapp.py

Launch a browser and go to http://localhost:7080.  This displays a page with a
list of links.  Each link tests out a different aspect of the authorisation
system.  The OpenID login will be triggered if a link requires authentication,
select go with the default URL set of, "http://localhost:7443/openid".  When
prompted for a username and password, enter pjk/testpassword 
respectively.

The links are secured with the policy file, policy.xml.  User attributes are
determined by the Attribute Authority configuration set in 
ndg.security.test.config.attributeauthority.sitea.siteAUserRoles
