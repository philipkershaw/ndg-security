Test SSL Client Authentication WSGI Middleware.  The middleware can be run
under paste instance - run 

$ python sslclientauthnapp.py

or install ndgsecurity.wsgi as a mod_wsgi app in Apache.  See this file for
details.

12/12/08: running under mod_wsgi is currently the only way the middleware will
work because it relies on SSL_CLIENT_CERT being set in environ.
